## What Is This Tower Up:Memo ? ðŸ¤”

- I wanted to create my own game as an introduction to Unity.
- This is my first prototype game, where I focused on learning and applying core game development concepts.
- Feel free to ask any questions regarding the project.

## Used Technologies

- I developed a 2D platformer game using Unity and C#.
- The game includes mechanics such as jumping, shooting, enemy AI (robots), and player movement.
- I implemented collision detection, a health system with a slider UI, and basic animations for the player.
- I used free assets from Bayat Games to accelerate development and focus on gameplay mechanics.
